              <p class = "st-description">Accumulating strength mentally and physically
        are both crucial when exercise comes into play. Burning fat AND building
        muscle? Sounds like the best of both worlds to us over at Romero Fitness.
        Along with age, Strength / Resistance Training helps prevent the natural
        loss of lean muscle mass with aging. Close to the age of 30, is when humans
       begin to experience muscle mass loss (generally 3-5% per year) which is
       something we dont want! Learn how to manipulate the muscles and emphasize
        growth everyday, while having an exciting experience every session!</p>

      into your strength training as efficiently as possible, come on in to make
